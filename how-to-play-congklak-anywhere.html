                <p>“How to Play Congklak Anywhere” centres around the human
                    need for play, using the Congklak, the Indonesian variation of
                    mancala board games, as a medium. Play is a common human
                    experience that enables its participants to explore who they
                    are through their relationships to the world, to other people
                    and to the materials they have access to. To be in play is to
                    explore what it means to be human, but being human involves
                    a lot of other complicated things in our daily routines. Creating
                    time and opportunities for play with the objects provided to us
                    by our environment limits our materiality but can enhance our
                    creativity.</br></br>
                    Opportunities for specific actions or activities provided by an
                    environment or object are known as affordances. Developed
                    by J.J. Gibson in the 1970s, affordance theory helps identify
                    how individuals interact with the features of the environment,
                    resulting in activities which take place in a specific context.
                    These opportunities are communicated and perceived through
                    cues, or visual elements designed into the environment that
                    indicate what activity a person can partake in within that
                    specific space.</br></br>
                    The final outcome of this project is a guidebook, modelled
                    after Y2K girls' diaries and planners which were often
                    colourful and fun in a way that encouraged its use with
                    stickers. It contains instructions on how to make the boards
                    I've made along the way as well as how to identify and create
                    play spaces out of your surrounding environment. Users can
                    also use a play map template that comes with the guidebook,
                    where people can draw the play spaces they've identified in an
                    area they often visit, along with stickers that say “THIS IS A
                    PLAY SITE”.</p>
