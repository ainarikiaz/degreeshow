                <p>UK Drill music, and wider relations to criminality, often have
                    blame misplaced on the individual over systems. The DIY
                    cultures we demonise are often celebrated retrospectively.
                </b></b>
                    'â€¦AND THEN THEY BUILD MONUMENTS TO YOU' appropriates
                    the protest aesthetics and memorabilia of the Miners' Strikes
                    and punk culture of the 1970s and 80s, asking how we can
                    remember communities that are censored, monitored and
                    banned. Recontextualising our current understandings of the
                    criminal justice system into familiar and tested mediums:
                    union banners, badges, and the concept of the rockstar - aims
                    to aid in a more contemporary and complete awareness of 'the
                    criminal'.
                </b></b>
                    A union banner, conceptualised and designed with prisoners,
                    results in endearing and complex representations of
                    conversations and ideas from the men themselves. Each panel
                    references paintings in the National Gallery: an insertion of
                    the criminal into high culture. The banner is supposed to be
                    interacted with, dissected and appreciated, in the same ways
                    we connect with fine art. The words are lines extracted from
                    a poem by Marcus, and the stories behind each section are
                    formed from conversations with Hashok.
                </b></b>
                    'DRILL NOT KILL' badges reference slogans and symbols
                    from the Miners' Strikes, directly comparing the two DIY
                    subcultures. The phrase aims to remove the music genrefrom its perceived responsibility in serious and violent crime,
                    calling attention to the hypocrisy and insincerity in the ways
                    authorities deal with the controversy surrounding drill. Slomotion
                    guitar smashing and Union Jack brandished imagery
                    explores the alienation of drill music and crime as 'un-British',
                    investigating the ways in which products of British government
                    policy can be punished or ignored by British government
                    authorities. Words and voice over by sociologist Lambros
                    Fatsis, featuring musician and artist Baby Panna.</p>
