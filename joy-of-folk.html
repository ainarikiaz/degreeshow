                <p>In order to attempt to reverse some of the effects of the
                    climate crisis, we have to work with the natural world, letting
                    go of the reins and walking with it. But most of us have no
                    idea what this looks or feels like. To best protect our green
                    spaces, whether that be big parks or our back gardens, we
                    first have to understand them and feel connected to them.
                    </br></br>
                    Using a template taken from the values of an English folk
                    festival from the South of England (wassailing, a thanksgiving
                    ceremony to the trees in orchard communities), this
                    project instructs the user on how to reintegrate into local
                    ecosystems through an emotional process.
                    </br></br>
                    This process guides the user on a journey of emotional care
                    for both the people in their community and the local green
                    space. Through this process, a relationship is slowly built up
                    between person and land which means that they as humans
                    can begin to care for the space from within, rather than as an
                    onlooker. It allows the user to incorporate aspects of their
                    own culture around nature and their own personal opinions
                    on the natural world and what they are interested in. This
                    project uses nostalgic, soft aesthetics to communicate an
                    aspect of play and gentleness so as to reassure the user that
                    even though climate change is scary and relentless, we can
                    do this, together.
                    </br></br>
                    The outcomes include a manual of how to perform the
                    process, an instructional film and a film that shows an
                    example of the instructions being interpreted by the designer
                    along with the props that went into that process.</p>
