                <p>Pain is invisible and also an extremely difficult thing to
                    communicate. This makes for an inevitably difficult interaction
                    between doctor and patient when trying to reach a diagnosis.
                    My project explores new ways of communicating physical pain
                    through taking the hidden sensation and bringing it out into
                    the open through visualising it. The aim here is by making pain
                    visual, empathy and understanding would facilitate doctorpatient
                    interaction. My idea was inspired by the great deal of
                    gender bias that exists within the healthcare system and is
                    about finding ways of overcoming this through re-designing
                    how we communicate pain in ways other than just verbal.</br></br>
                    After speaking with Alice Gow who has a spinal injury and
                    suffers from chronic pain, I used her visualisations of the
                    injury and of the pain she experiences to determine design
                    decisions on the sculpture. For example, Alice spoke of
                    associating static and migraine aura with her pain which is
                    why some of the fabric is printed with this pattern. A warm
                    yellow colour, as Alice described it, was a strong component
                    of her visualisations of the pain, hence the consistent use
                    of the colour throughout the sculpture. Some of the fabric is
                    filled with sand bags to add a heaviness which was directly
                    inspired by Alices account of a heaviness in her body. The
                    radial gradients came from thinking about ways in which pain
                    is already communicated visually. Often on packaging for
                    pain killers, the pain is indicated by a glowing red orb in the
                    location of injury. The idea also came from weather maps and
                    how they show intensity or severity with gradients of different
                    colours.</p>
