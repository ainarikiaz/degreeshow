                <p>I talked to people cross-legged on their living room sofas, in
                    empty art studios, sweaty on bedsheets, while they were in
                    relationships, just after they'd had their heart broken. I try to
                    experience their feelings alongside them, to understand their
                    words and read into the objects they keep in their nightstands;
                    things that are close in intimate moments. I want to know how
                    they feel about casual sex. How do they feel about sharing comfort
                    with someone they barely know or at least have promised no loyalty to?</b></b>
                    After conversations in pubs with friends, I realised a lot of
                    people didn't really know how they felt about hooking up. Some
                    were traumatised but felt uncomfortable sharing due to fear of
                    backlash whereas others enjoyed it and just assumed everyone
                    felt the same, therefore never feeling the need to discuss it.
                    This is a static support group with the aim of allowing you to
                    either come to terms with your own experiences or to better
                    understand those around you.</b></b>
                    My publication features ten interviews with young adults living
                    in London who have all participated in hookup culture. Their
                    stories are varied but are honest accounts of how casual sex
                    in our current culture has affected them.</b></b>
                    Afterwards I realised that some of the interviews strangely fit
                    together. Certain things were recurrently talked about such
                    as earrings or water, and others seemed to directly respond
                    to each other, including two people who both said they felt
                    disgusted by themselves. I combined quotes from various
                    interviews, slightly adjusting them and turning them into a
                    dialogue between a man and woman. The film that resulted
                    from these is a hypothetical conversation between two people
                    who have shagged.</p>
