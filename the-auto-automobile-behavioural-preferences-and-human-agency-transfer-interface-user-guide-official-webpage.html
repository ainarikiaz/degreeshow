                <pre>How would you describe the relationships you have with people you don't know? The first time you meet someone is key to their lasting impression of you. You may not think much about how many people you meet everyday, because what exactly is a meet? Consider technology, your phone, and how many people it meets on your behalf everyday. Are they meeting you for the first time when they see your profile, or do they meet your profile? When we use technology it takes our face, our words, and it repeats them back to itself and to others as a way to follow through our intentions. Or it doesn't, because it can't. How much of technology is just 'computer talking to computer', acting as a substitute to human interaction, because the world needs interactions to BE a society, but it is also sometimes inconvenient for humans to have to do it. 

On a road with autonomous cars, there is plenty of interaction, but between people, machines and machines. We understand the way we are perceived without knowing how. The cars choices on the road are pre-determined in code based on the designers legacy understanding of the function and interaction of people in cars, operating via the human authority of the owner/operator and the corporate manufacturer.
    
The Auto-Automobile Behavioural Preferences and Human Agency Transfer Interface and User Guide - Is my way of thinking about our complexifying-simplifying relationship with tech, specifically the change in our relationship with cars with the development of driverless technology. We must try to consider the way technology is developed and how it will effect what there is already, to prevent convenience beyond logic and human existence.</pre>
