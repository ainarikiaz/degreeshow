                <pre>The Play of Disservice has opened up a conversation to redefine and remould strong stances that pertain to injustice, trauma ect.

This work embodies the stories of many, those whom I hold dear as well as those whose lives I have traversed. The aim of collecting these stories is to provoke thought and build a moment of relation when shared. This work is not to directly solve problems as design may have in its traditional sense, it is to bring attention to and take notice of one's own experiences. This intention is actualised through the action of playing in a curated room, a dollhouse room. The person who participates in this project, chooses their own objects which will represent people in their story. They are to later narrate and act out, with those chosen objects, an event in their life that showcases a moment of disservice which may have affected that person in a psychological and or physical sense.

The ongoing collection of stories are documented through film, audio and photography. I have taken the stories which were so kindly shared with me to make a short film to recreate moments of disservice. Thus being a form of acknowledging and voicing out concealed stories that would otherwise be ignored - leading to a blind act of disservice.

The realisations made thus far, from the reenactment of events through play, have left participants with a sense of nostalgia, as well as a time of reflection on what disservice and injustice means to them personally.

I invite you to partake in moments of joy, sadness and realisation of hidden truths and newly formed emblems.</pre>
