                <p>“As she fell back into the Land Of Trust, The Crone Alchemist
                    surrendered to the waves of cosmic intuition. A creature who shape
                    shifts into a butterfly by day and a wise old alchemist by night. She
                    is an earthly force who lives in between air and space, weaving her
                    wisdom into potions of healing that carry the stories of her land.” -rs
                </br>                </br>

                    My project began with the intention of exploring the power of
                    love's wisdom through the practice of weaving. The repetitive
                    act of weaving created a path where the movement of my
                    body and the stillness of my mind met as one and led me to
                    question what is ritual? And what is my story? I gravitated towards
                    Celtic mythology and folklore as a source of inspiration and
                    knowledge. I then embarked on a journey to reclaim my 'mythic
                    feminine' and goddess heritage. With nothing but intuition and
                    creative curiosity, my project started to unfold a mythological
                    narrative which allowed my objects to sit in a fictional
                    world that intertwined with reality. For my final outcome, I
                    created a mythical apron made from various potions of agar
                    bioplastic. As my journey continued, my inner Goddess began
                    to metamorphose into the archetype of the old wise woman
                    or also known as The Crone Alchemist. She holds the power of
                    age and time, of retribution and of transformation. She is the
                    guardian and protector of the land and carries her ancient
                    tales throughout time. She is the divine hag, a symbol of birth
                    and death that lives amongst us all. She is as real as you and
                    I, the only difference is that we can't see her. By embodying
                    the wisdom of The Crone Alchemist, I was able to reside in
                    animism to teach me unconventional ways of costume design.
                    This allowed my final outcome to be born from the land in
                    which I live in and shift my project from a place of discovery
                    to a place of completion.</p>
