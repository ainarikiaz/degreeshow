<p>Amplified Agencies started with my care for natural agencies
    around us such as the wind, the river, light and sound. There
    is a tendency to think of the human species as something
    that exists separate from the natural world, and that these
    agencies have some kind of dependency on humans. The design
    of our world is oriented around humans and rejects the input of
    other invisible agents. However, the world isn't just occupied
    by the human species; overlooked agencies contribute to the
    functional mechanisms of the world.</b></b>
    I am interested to know what kind of designs can form when
    incorporating alternative agencies in the design process.
    Speculating upon the different realities, rules and rituals we
    can create with their input. With architecture for example, how
    can a structure adopt the fluidity of the wind and embrace its
    force instead of building a wall to reject its input?</b></b>
    Aplified Agencies: Wind focuses solely on the agency of the wind.
    To begin to address my concerns and improve awareness of
    this force, I have designed two hairy objects to be installed in
    an indoor space. Each is connected to a different wind speed
    sensor, one indoors and one outdoors. When the sensor outside
    picks up any wind, its corresponding hairy object will flick,
    mimicking wind swept hair and reminding you of the wind. The
    sensor inside can be blown on to match the outdoor wind speed
    to achieve movement in the second hairy object.</b></b>
    This object provides a way to see the wind's ongoing
    relationship with us humans. At the moment of its highlighted
    presence, mimicking wind movement does not merely represent
    its presence but materialises and accumulates our relations.
    I am reflecting on my concern for how the wind performs and
    acts in the human-oriented design structure of the world.</p>
