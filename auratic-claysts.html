                <h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/auraticclaysts">@auraticclaysts</a></h3>

                <p>This project started with the appearance of NFTs and
                    blockchain, and with questions about what will happen to the
                    physical art forms with so much digital oriented art? How will the
                    physical ones be represented in digital mediums? I eventually
                    concluded that digital mediums lack a unique quality, a specific
                    ingredient called 'aura' by Walter Benjamin. This absence
                    resulted in a lower value perception of digitally created art
                    forms.</b></b>
                    The NFT and blockchain are only introducing a sort of artificial
                    scarcity to something that inherently lacks aura, a piece of
                    art that is only made to be an original and to be tracked and
                    acknowledged as an original.</b></b>
                    To surpass the usual purpose of NFTs, the concept of Clayst
                    was created. A Clayst is the same piece of wild clay that
                    keeps changing its form and use. When you get a Clayst, you
                    get a part of each previous owner's story and a piece of their
                    existence. You get all that it has become with each handling.
                    Additionally, you get to explore the original through its
                    documented digital copies of the past forms.</b></b>
                    The aura of the physical Claysts can exist because of the
                    digital medium that the reincarnations live on. It's a symbiotic
                    relationship between the physical Clayst and its digital copies.
                    If one of them ceases to exist, the aura disappears. Because
                    of this documentation, the very piece of clay becomes an NFT
                    but superior. Its Instagram account is the blockchain on which the NFT exists. It's the blockchain of all the things it's been
                    before. However, instead of just keeping track of who owns
                    the original, instead of saying “this is the original block of
                    clay”, it should be acknowledged that it grows aura because
                    of its digitised reincarnations. Therefore, a Clayst acts like a
                    complete summarisation and materialisation of aura.</p>
