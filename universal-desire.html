            <div class="description">
                <pre>Today, there are many books and films about space exploration. For example, 'Don't Look Up', 'Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets' or 'Wandering the Earth'. Yuval Noah Harari's Homo Deus: a Brief History of Tomorrow
mentions, “after the 21st century, the plan, fame and war that have long threatened human survival and development have been overcome, and mankind is facing a new topic: immediacy, happiness and productivity. Become a man with divinity...“

These films and books make me think: If the Earth is no longer suitable for human habitation, who will be able to leave the planet? Where will these people go? Will there be any change in class in the future? My project centres around these questions.

I believe that the limited resources on the Earth can't let everyone leave. Some people leave and go to different planets to create new cultures. These planets are created by people possesing different ideals of faith, power and entertainment. These planets also show different desires in their hearts.

My project is divided into sections, and I think each aspect is very useful. For example, when it comes to clothing, the design of each planet takes into account different aspects. The clothing of Belief Planet draws lessons from religious customs and habits of various countries, and the Power Planet refers to the past and present rulers of various regions. The costume of Entertainment Planet is derived from those of drag queens. The clothes on Earth are functional. My design can be made into virtual garments, ensuring that clothing and architecture can be designed for future meta-universe and reality.

In addition, this project evaluates some problems: When the Earth is destroyed, who can be brought into space? Will the government really take everyone away from Earth? In fact, the design of this universe serves as a metaphor for the class and desire of modern society. For people with money and status, they desire only more, but for ordinary people, their desire is to live well.</pre>
