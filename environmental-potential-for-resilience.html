            <div class="description">
                <p>The time spent inside a structure, architecture, designed
                    interior and nature, has the potential to shape every
                    moment of our lives. It influences our values, beliefs, mental
                    resources, and inner strength so that we can withstand the
                    pressures in our daily lives and help us to clear the path
                    as we go. In this achievement-oriented society, we face
                    enormous pressure to push ourselves past our limits to
                    achieve our goals and we easily become exhausted in this
                    process. However, our mental strength and willpower are
                    finite, like other precious and depleted resources on Earth.
                    They are not springs that never dry up. Hence, we need to
                    take care of them in a sustainable way. This interior design
                    proposes that all of us should take a pause from the taxing
                    and competitive world that we inhabit and retreat into
                    ourselves to rejuvenate our potential and treat ourselves as
                    we treat others: carefully and generously. I have selected two
                    users, one, a real person with a hoarding disorder, the other, a
                    fictional character who was born on a liner ship where he has
                    lived his entire life, who has a fear of stepping on land.
                    </br></br>
                    The environment that surrounds a user has a notable
                    influence on them and their potential. We can predict and
                    design to influence the users with an elaborately mapped
                    out interior design plan and guide a series of activities to be
                    conducted in that space. By ensuring that support is given
                    from the designed environment, individual users can develop
                    resilience to their maximum potential and achieve better
                    results to reach goals and overcome difficulties. Considering
                    this effect of space design, this project aims to enhance
                    users' inner resources and strengths and increase the
                    functional efficiency of space with technologies.</p>
