            <div class="description">
                <p>China's three-child birth policy has a lot of opposition from
                    public opinion. According to a survey, the quality of the
                    parent-child relationship in a three-child family affects the
                    development of the three-child family. I designed a specific
                    storybook about the parent-child relationship of a Chinese
                    three-child family. Parents issue an instruction in order to
                    reduce the cost of education, and the environment that is easy
                    to cause emotional violence to children leads to alienation of
                    the parent-child relationship.</br></br>
                    Help parents reflect on their children's needs, abandon toxic
                    education after independent thinking, and accompany their
                    children to grow together. Help those who have three children
                    in the future understand that this is a prudent decision, learn
                    to be a positive parent-child balance, and iterate the social
                    parent-child alienation problem.</br></br>
                    I chose a group of traditional Chinese herbs that balance the
                    relationship, Pinellia and Ginger. The poison taught by mother
                    is Pinellia, and the antidote is mother's tears and ginger.
                    People will become mute after eating Pinellia and ginger can
                    detoxify. Partridges and Bird Gods are designed, and Chinese
                    people ate partridges to nourish their bodies in ancient times.
                    In 2021, the partridge is listed as a globally endangered
                    species by IUCN. The partridge is naturally fond of eating
                    Pinellia, Bird God opened a Pinellia restaurant to help the
                    partridge eat Pinellia to protect itself.</br></br>
                    In the real world, the mother's children have become dolls,
                    and the Bird god sweetly coaxes the child to keep the child
                    to help her with errands. It depicts that parents ignore the
                    needs of their children in order to achieve their goals. The
                    composition of children's emotional management mechanism
                    originates from parents. The behavior of the parents also did
                    not find the problem and continued because they had the same
                    situation when they were children.</p>
