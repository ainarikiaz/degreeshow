                <p>The project is designed to criticise people who do not take
                    the environmental crisis seriously. The biggest problem facing
                    humanity today is changes in the environmental climate.
                    According to Jared Diamond, the author of Guns, Germs, and
                    Steel (1997, awarded a Pulitzer Prize), the climate crisis is the
                    rate at which things are deteriorating, the rate at which the
                    world's population is growing, the rate at which the forests
                    are being cut down. These are dramatically devastating. In
                    about 30 years, everything will be irreversible. There's no
                    turning back. If we don't solve these problems by 2050, it will
                    be too late. Can you imagine how harsh the environment will be in
                    30 years? Despite these movements, people cannot recognise
                    how serious it is. Some even respond cynically, saying that
                    this is fake news. This project felt it necessary to criticise this
                    situation. There is no more time to escape this issue. As this
                    project proceeded, it aimed to encourage people to experience
                    the climate crisis around the corner and to represent how
                    uncomfortable the situation waiting for humanity is.
                    </br></br>
                    The project designs the coffee that will exist in 2080. Coffee
                    is one of the favourite drinks in daily life. If people will not
                    drink coffee anymore due to the climate crisis, how will they feel?
                    It is probably hopeless news - especially for the people who
                    fall in love with coffee. Many people do not know that coffee
                    will disappear in the future due to environmental changes. By
                    2050, suitable coffee farmland is expected to have halved
                    due to rising temperatures, pests, and fungi. Wild coffee will
                    be wiped from the face of the planet by the year 2080. Using
                    the point that many people like coffee, the project tried to
                    give a shock by showing the life of the coffee in 2080. When
                    people think of images of futuristic life, they tend to think of
                    convenient, mechanical, and utility life. Unfortunately, in the future, the heated climate will no longer allow the suitable
                    technologies mentioned above to follow suit as long as they
                    promote environmental pollution.
                    </br></br>
                    To reflect these changes, the project proposed coffee objects
                    existing in 2080 when the coffee is almost extinct. To let
                    climate crisis deniers directly experience how uncomfortable it
                    would be in the future if they do not believe.</p>
